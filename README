# Wordpress Starting Framework

## Introduction

I write a lot of Wordpress projects and use this as an ongoing starting point that gets updated with every project with new discoveries, and updates to industry best practices. 

## Goal

I do custom theming and don't want to inherit styles into my projects. Stylistically, this is a bare bones framework. It also incorporates techniques I use on every project. I want to add to this - not remove from it on a per project basis. The exception to this is '/lib/optional.php' which is an ongoing repository of highly useful functions that are often used; but not in every project. (eg Dynamic Sidebars, post-thumbnail support)

## Dependancies
- jQuery (latest version)
- Modernizr (latest version)
- LESS
- CSS Best Practice (normalize, minimal reset)
- I've borrowed heavily from HTML5 Boilerplate, Foundation, Bootstrap plus countless dissected Wordpress templates and blog posts.
