*	1. BASE
*	Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively 
*	single element selectors but it could include attribute 
*	selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or 
*	sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that 
*	wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.

/*
*	2. LAYOUT
*	Layout rules divide the page into sections. 
*	Layouts hold one or more modules together.

/*
*	3. MODULE
*	Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our 
*	design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, 
*	the product lists and so on.

/* 
*	4. STATES
*	State rules are ways to describe how our modules or 
*	layouts will look when in a particular state. Is it 
*	hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are 
*	about describing how a module or layout looks on screens 
*	that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing 
*	how a module might look in different views like the home 
*	page or the inside page.
